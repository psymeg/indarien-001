<p>I want to ask you a personal question. What was my dads middle name? Sorry, percival. I want to ask you a percival question.</p>

<p>As a Librarian, people often ask me to help them with all sorts of tech, but today was a first.</p>
<p>Today a customer got me to show them how to use the remote control for their heatpump (air con).</p>

<p>Ive been looking for ways to address the feeling of failure i sometimes have, when trying to change parts of my life.</p>
<p>Its unhelpful.</p>
<p>And a perspective that i really like is to stop viewing the situation as a list of tasks to achieve, and instead as a set of personal values.</p>
<p>So, instead of saying "I want to eat 3 healthy meals tomorrow", and if it doesnt happen, i have failed...</p>
<p>...its saying "Im the kind of person who works on eating better."</p>
<p>That stays true whether I eat well tomorrow or not.</p>
<p>You can't fail at values.</p>
<p>And i can just steer myself back towards my values. Those decisions will keep coming up, and i can keep remembering my values, work on doing well.</p>
<p>Steer the ship (without having to sink it first).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I think it helps me.</p>
