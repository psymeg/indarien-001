<P>Bill Manhire is New Zealand’s first Poet Laureate, author of <I>Songs of My Life</I>, <I>Zoetropes</I>, <I>Milky Way Bar</I> etc., editor of <I>Mutes and Earthquakes</I> and <I>100 New Zealand Poems</I>. <I>Mutes and Earthquakes</I> is the progeny of the Creative Writing course taught by Bill at Victoria. Salient’s Books Editor caught up with him recently to discuss his recent trip to Antarctica and other stuff.</P>
<P>Simon: I understand you recently spent a couple of weeks on the ice. Could you tell me what brought that on?</P>
<P>Bill:</B> The New Zealand government has recently set up a corporation to manage its interests and relationship with Antarctica. Known as Antarctica New Zealand, this group has set up a scheme whereby artists can spend time in Antarctica. They intend to send two people down a year though this year three were sent - the painter Nigel Brown, poet Chris Orsman and myself. We were down there for two weeks, but that is not necessarily how it has to be - if, for example, Maurice Gee wanted to go down and spend the winter there writing a novel then I guess that could be arranged. the Americans have a similar scheme but it makes even more sense for New Zealand. We are the one country in the world where everyone knows someone who has been there. Scott left for the South Pole from Lyttelton and Port Chalmers; and of course the Erebus crash has left a real psychic imprint on New Zealanders.</P>
<B><P>Simon: So how did you spend your time down there?</P>
<P>Bill:</B> Well, we camped out for five nights - on the banks of a frozen lake, at a penguin colony. and I went to the South Pole - it was a three hour flight from Scott Base on a Hercules. We had forty-five minutes there - a speed tour of the American base. It was a bit like being on a moon base, or at the edge of the galaxy. They live under a large geodesic dome, in a very marginal environment - the temperature when we were there was about minus 50 Celsius. you go from one area to another through these thick insulated doors much like you get in a walk-in freezer, except that the freezers are working in reverse. Then we had a four hour flight back to Scott Base so essentially seven hours flying to spend three quarters of an hour at the South Pole.</P>
<B><P>Simon: You make a few references to Antarctica in your writing. Why do you think this is?</P>
<P>Bill</B>: It could have something to do with being born in Invercargill. Antarctica is the next stop across the water after Stewart Island.</P>
<B><P>Simon: So are you intending to construct a literary history of Antarctica?</P>
<P>Bill:</B> Funny you should mention that. I am currently working on an anthology of writing about Antarctica. There have been hundreds of novels written about Antarctica; mainly by people who have never been there. And literature has always played a role in Antarctica; for example when Scott and Shackleton went down they took Tennyson and Browning to read. Excerpts from Scott’s diaries will be in the anthology. Scott knew he was going to die, and this makes the diaries really interesting - he wasn’t just writing the &quot;walked 15 miles and had lunch&quot; kind of thing, he was consciously crafting the story of his life, in the full knowledge that people would be reading it after he had died.</P>
<B><P>Simon: Was the trip productive for you as a writer?</P>
<P>Bill:</B> Definitely, it was an amazing experience. I wrote five poems whilst down there and made a lot of field notes, much as a scientist would. Though unlike a scientist I don’t seem to have the time to write them up. We also published a small book, called Homelight. It was Chris Orsman’s idea. Nigel [Brown] did the a woodcut for the cover, and we all wrote poems for it. It was written and printed on the ice. We also did a poetry reading at Scott Base. It seemed to go down really well, and a fair number of Americans came over from McMurdo Station for the evening. And there is a documentary coming out about the whole trip; we had a cameraperson and a director with us.</P>
<B><P>Simon: Could you tell us something about your rites and responsibilities as Poet Laureate?</P>
<P>Bill:</B> Well, the traditional, English Poet Laureate is completely different from my role. I don’t have to write mawkish drivel celebrating the Queen Mother’s birthday. Basically I took up the position with the understanding that part of my role was to boost the profile of poetry in New Zealand. As a result I do this fortnightly spot on Kim Hill and I do a bit of charity work. Last year one of my poems was auctioned for $800 to help raise funds for Barnado’s. This year I am auctioning a poem to help with Alan Duff’s Books in Homes program. The position as Poet Laureate lasts for two years; then Te Mata Wineries will appoint a new poet. Part of the deal is that the poet has to put together a book of poems at the end of their tenure. Te Mata will subsidise the cost of publication.</P>
<B><P>Simon: Your work seems ideally suited to a particularly middle class kind of audience. Is this intentional?</P>
<P>Bill:</B> I don’t really find those sort of terms that useful - at least at the point where a poem is being written. I mean what is the middle class? And even if one could say what it was then I feel that trying to invent some sort of idealised kiwi bloke or blokess as a notional reader would be neither interesting or successful for me as a writer. I would rather push my imagination, stretch the limits of my head. I mean, that’s probably why this awkward term ‘creative writing’ exists - you’re striving to bring something new into being - that is the primary thing for me.</P>
<B><P>Simon: So what do you think of Sam Hunt?</P>
<P>Bill:</B> I think that he is a bloody good poet. He has, for a lot of people taken away the rarefied atmosphere of poetry, and has been very important as far as getting poetry out there is concerned. He is definitely one person who has made sure that poetry is one of those things which carries on.</P>
<B><P>Simon: Graham Lay after judging the recent Takahe Short Story competition bemoaned the lack of young male writers entering the competition. Your writing course likewise has a marked preponderance of female writers - why do you think this might be?</P>
<P>Bill</B>: I don’t think that there is any one reason for this. Generally speaking the people who apply for the course tend to be more on the mature side of student life. They tend to have more life experience, more reading and writing experience. There are only ten places available in the M.A. programme and those mature students tend to crowd out the younger writers. The fact that the majority of writers are female - seven out of ten this year - is possibly because women tend to hang on to the idea of themselves as writers for longer than men; a lot of the men having also already headed off into their careers.</P>
