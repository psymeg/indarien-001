<p>TLDR, your funny bone wasn't designed to send pain messages, so it just sends weird data if you bang it.</p>

<p>The most genuinely hopeful post I have seen for a while.</p>
<h3 align="center">17 March at 00:21</h3>
<p>Now, where was I? Oh, i figured out linking progress to social media doesn’t work because i dont always feel like it, so i made a handy chart in a book, and added colour as an executive function tip. Anyway, for many days i forgot i made this, which would have made some of these numbers higher, but not all. I think my longest walk this year was about 15km. And i've read a lot this year. But man, i really dont like typing poems. And i don't dance unless i do it on purpose.  Ideally it's more about doing things regularly, of course, this is just for fun.  I've dropped some things off the list, and I welcome suggestions for new categories.</p>
<p>For those of you playing at home, i'm up to:<ul><li>26 beats</li><li>19 pressups against the wall</li><li>10 yoga stretches</li><li>9 papers filed</li><li>9 pages read</li><li>7 friends talked with</li><li>7 km walked</li><li>6 minutes danced</li><li>2 poems typed</li></ul><p>Today i drummed 27 beats, and filed 10 papers, did 11 yoga stretches (building up to an hour a week), did 20 pressups and danced for 7 minutes. Read ten pages. Also did some gardening and worked on some zines. That'll do. Pottering i call it.</p>

<p>Hello fellow human. Hope you are having an artificially intelligent day.</p>
<h3 align="center">14 March at 10:10</h3>
<p>Spotify was better without video. Instagram was better without video.</p>
<h3 align="center">14 March at 10:09</h3>
<p>Oh! I went to Kaikoura. Did I tell you? First time I’ve hitchhiked in over 20 years. Rented a room and had a beautiful couple days. Walked the peninsula coastline, which was gorgeous, full of colours and texture. And baby seals! Almost no photos cause i made a point of putting my phone down.</p>
<h3 align="center">14 March at 10:08</h3>
<p>I don't know how much better I would have coped with my entire adult life if I had eaten better food.</p>
<h3 align="center">14 March at 10:08</h3>
<p>People should say "You beauty!" more, like they did in the olden days. . (To mean "Go you!" or "Hooray!" I mean, i wasnt talking about describing looks.) . [context: being 50, in New Zealand, and seeing a lot of phrases my Dad used not being used by my kids] . TLDR: You beauty!</p>
<h3 align="center">14 March at 10:06</h3>
<p>My courgettes are done. Another beauty of a season.</p>
<h3 align="center">14 March at 10:05</h3>
<p>Why my courgettes so spiky this year?</p>

<p>Can't remember where i got this from, but whatever they're selling, Im buying.</p>
