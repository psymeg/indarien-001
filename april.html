<p>Well far out I've run out of memes. Finally. I must have done a bit of doomscrolling a while back.</p>
<h3 align="center">23 April at 00:45</h3>
<p>I just kinda love this.</p>
<p>The comfort of just visualizing people making yummy food.</p>
<h3 align="center">23 April at 00:43</h3>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Please explain.</p>
<h3 align="center">23 April at 00:41</h3>
<p>There are so many thoughts in this small graph. Interested to hear yours.</p>
<p>Idea number one: Kiwis leave home real early, and used to leave earlier.</p>

<p>New rule: only one word per person per poem.</p>
<p>This one was started by Maree so no more words from them this poem.</p>

<p>Hey, help a bunch of poets out? Me and katie, gretchen, alle, clinton, simon and jenni have written the first two lines of a poem, but we need some help finishing it off.</p>
<p>It'll end up 3 lines - 5 syllables, 7 syllables, 5 syllables.</p>
<p>Â¿Have you got a 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 syllable word that you reckon would go well after:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>fraught memory sighs</p>
<p>longing flash of haunted flesh</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Chuck a thought below, if you like.</p>
<p>Lets finish it off.</p>
<h3 align="center">18 April at 02:41</h3>
<p>Thanks again for the 17 words you guys gave me.</p>
<p>One of the things I decided Id try with them is make haiku using just those 17 words.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>A 3 line poem, 5 syllables, 7 syllables, 5 syllables, using just:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Fraught Submerge Secateurs Dark Myriad Ineffable Fun Spoon Preposterous Shrill Hoarfrost Sandwich Kuchisabishii Bees Frankly Shimmered Lectern</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Or, put another way:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>1 - Fraught dark fun spoon shrill bees</p>
<p>2 - Submerge hoarfrost sandwich frankly shimmered lectern</p>
<p>3 - Secateurs myriad</p>
<p>4 - Ineffable preposterous</p>
<p>5 - Kuchisabishii</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Feel free to have a go.</p>

<p>Whats the best advice you've never followed?</p>
<h3 align="center">16 April at 01:41</h3>
<p>Christchurch people - have you noticed more tiny flying insects in your house this year? Or is it just cause I've got more houseplants?</p>
<p>Like things the size of sandflies.</p>
<p>And, um, are they flying up your nose?</p>
<h3 align="center">16 April at 01:38</h3>
<p>I heard about a study recently, and I'd love to hear more about it.</p>
<p>For years now there's been this conversation about how people are ruder and bolder online, that the anonymity of the internet means people are meaner than theyd ever be in real life.</p>
<p>The study concluded this isnt true AT ALL.</p>
<p>That actually, if you're an asshole on the internet, youre also an asshole in real life, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Polite and quiet and kind people are everywhere, and they tend to be quiet on the internet too, making most conversations on the web Troll vs Troll.</p>
<p>Asshole vs Asshole.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Your thoughts welcomed.</p>
<h3 align="center">16 April at 01:32</h3>
<p>Lets play Faceboo Haiku.</p>
<p>We're making a three line poem.</p>
<p>Five syllables / seven syllables / five syllables.</p>
<p>New rule: only one word per person per poem.</p>
<p>This one was started by Katie so no more words from them this poem.</p>
<p>1/17</p>
<p>Ready set go.</p>
<p>Oh, first word is "fraught".</p>
<h3 align="center">15 April at 00:04</h3>
<p>Well, thats hard to argue with.</p>
<h3 align="center">15 April at 00:02</h3>
<p>I don't really use the word "bitch" any more, though i do occasionally use the word "yousexybitch".</p>
<h3 align="center">15 April at 00:02</h3>
<p>Please I would like some words.</p>
<p>Can some of you give me 1 word each please?</p>
<p>I need 17.</p>
<p>EDIT... thats enough! Thanks guys. I have plans for your words. More on this later.</p>

<p>Yesterday I walked 8km.</p>
<p>And a few more.</p>
<p>Decided a goal is to walk from my house to lyttelton.</p>
<h3 align="center">12 April</h3>
<p>Gardening friends, please check my thinking here.</p>
<p>I've been harvesting cherry tomatoes recently.</p>
<p>The toms with split skins, I always throw away. I figure split skins makes them more open to bacteria, and bugs, and such.</p>
<p>But is that right? Or did I just make that up?</p>
<h3 align="center">11 April</h3>
<p>I love this so much.</p>
<p>Don't know the name of the photographer.</p>
<p>Witty combo of two artworks, about a hundred years apart.</p>
<h3 align="center">9 April</h3>
<p>What a fucking magnificent planet we all live on.</p>
<h3 align="center">9 April</h3>
<p>My kids did nothing for 12 years straight.  No idea how many crocodiles were involved.</p>
<h3 align="center">8 April</h3>
<p>Ironically, this plaque was neither beautiful nor useful, so they gave it away.</p>
<h3 align="center">8 April</h3>
<p>Anyway, the conversation is dangerously over-rehearsed in my mind.</p>
<p>What could go wrong?</p>
<h3 align="center">8 April</h3>
<p>I hate how every book or article about changing habits and building routines includes the phrase "...and eventually its just as easy as brushing your teeth..."</p>
<p>Yeah thanks. I struggle with that too.</p>
<h3 align="center">5 April</h3>
<p>TIL that the only reason Van Gogh is famous is that after he and his brother died, his brothers widow Jo Gogh relentlessly promoted his work.</p>
<h3 align="center">5 April</h3>
<p>I'm much better at the not basics.</p>
<h3 align="center">4 April</h3>
<p>Historian is such a cocky job.</p>
<p>Like "I know for sure what happened in 1450, you guys have had it wrong all along haha, im so certain im gonna write a book".</p>
<p>Dude!</p>
<p>You weren't there?</p>
<h3 align="center">4 April</h3>
<p>TGI Friday.</p>
<h3 align="center">3 April</h3>
<p>Thanks so much to Catalyst and Ciaran and Space Academy for throwing another beautiful night of words.</p>
<p>Thanks for giving me a place to share my poems.</p>
<p>Thanks to the poetry community in christchurch for having so many gorgeously interesting warm and clever people in it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the praise, and for receiving my praise, and for normalizing a space where grown adults are generous with praise.</p>
<p>Its an oasis.</p>
<p>Community.</p>
<p>And it felt really good to be back.</p>
<h3 align="center">3 April</h3>
<p>I wonder if Julia Greives ever recovered from the "I dont want to sit next to Dylan" incident of 1986.</p>
<h3 align="center">2 April</h3>
<p>A 19 year old called me childish today, which I take as a good sign.</p>
<h3 align="center">2 April</h3>
<p>Im at that age where if id had a kid when i was 17, and theyd had a kid when they were 17, and their kid had had a kid when they were 17, Id be a great grandad now.</p>
