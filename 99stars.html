<p>Thanks so much for throwing another beautiful night of words. Thanks for giving me a space to share my poems. Thanks to the poetry community for having so many gorgeously interesting warm and clever people in it. Thanks for the praise, and for receiving my praise, and for normalizing a space where grown adults are generous with praise. </p>

<p>Now, where was I? Oh, i figured out linking progress to social media doesn’t work because i dont always feel like it, so i made a handy chart in a book, and added colour as an executive function tip. Anyway, for many days i forgot i made this, which would have made some of these numbers higher, but not all. I think my longest walk this year was about 15km. And i've read a lot this year. But man, i really dont like typing poems. And i dont dance unless i do it on purpose.  Ideally it's more about doing things regularly, of course, this is just for fun.  I've dropped some things off the list, and I welcome suggestions for new categories. . For those of you playing at home, i'm up to:<ul><li>26 beats</li><li>19 pressups against the wall</li><li>10 yoga stretches</li><li>9 papers filed</li><li>9 pages read</li><li>7 friends talked with</li><li>7 km walked</li><li>6 minutes danced</li><li>2 poems typed</li></ul>Today i drummed 27 beats, and filed 10 papers, did 11 yoga stretches (building up to an hour a week), did 20 pressups and danced for 7 minutes. Read ten pages. Also did some gardening and worked on some zines. That'll do. Pottering i call it.</p>

<p>Oh! I went to Kaikoura. Did I tell you? First time I’ve hitchhiked in over 20 years. Rented a room and had a beautiful couple days. Walked the peninsula coastline, which was gorgeous, full of colours and texture. And baby seals! Almost no photos cause i made a point of putting my phone down.</p>

<p>People should say "You beauty!" more, like they did in the olden days. . (To mean "Go you!" or "Hooray!" I mean, i wasnt talking about describing looks.) . [context: being 50, in New Zealand, and seeing a lot of phrases my Dad used not being used by my kids] . TLDR: You beauty!</p>

<p>I want to show you my pumpkin plant. I didnt plant it, it grew out the bottom of my compost bucket, in a spot with very little sun. I pitied it. But it found a way. More specifically, it found a tree to climb. Its about 2 metres tall. 7 foot.</p>

<p>Once, when we were young, we went to an outdoor dance party that wasnt good, so we decided to drive to the west coast and watch the sun rise. We got to the beach and turned around to watch the sun rise over the hills, because, you know, West Coast.</p>

<p>Libraries are sacred places, paid for and made for every single person in a community. They are not to be invaded by bullies. I don't usually share anything re Brian Tamaki, but he can get the fuck out of "storming" Libraries. For the rest, I'll leave it to this very eloquent post by Chris Hipkins.</p>

Very roughly. And made one awkward phonecall.</p>
<p>Trying to figure out what else to include in these numbers. The list on my wardrobe says FOOD EXERCISE DRIVING ART CONNECTION. I should be able to do something with that.</p><h3>29/01/25</h3>
<p>Koko has moved into their new house. Their first grownup house.</p>
<h3>29/01/25</h3>
<p>29jan25. I got asked today if blondes have more fun and i didni't know what to say. Today I read 1 page of a book. Garfield. Drummed 19 beats. Ate at least two different vegetables. And looked pretty doing it.</p>
<h3>28/01/25</h3>
<p>I really enjoy hedgehogs. Every time i see one i think ""Man, you're great." And I say quietly "Hello."</p>
<h3>28/01/25</h3>

<p>You can buy cookie cutters for making gingerbread that slot together into dinosaurs and shit, and people dont talk about it enough.</p>
<h3>28/01/25</h3>
<p>These are, by the way, the spikiest courgettes i've ever grown.</p>
<h3>28/01/25</h3> 
<p>28 1 2025. Today I ate 1 different vegetable. You can probably see where im going with this. Also I did 15 pressups, and drummed 18 beats. (Actually I played a tabla for about ten minutes, but im keeping that one easy.) And I picked some tomatoes and courgettes out of my garden. You know what they say. We'll burn that bridge when we come to it.</p>
<h3>26/01/25</h3> 
<p>26.1.25 . Today I walked 6km. Oh, and I got a little taller, as you can see.</p>
<h3>25/01/25</h3> 
<p>Today i talked to 6 friends, including seeing a mates house for the first time. Bought a bunch of house plants and was given some worm wee. Excellent. I drummed 17 beats. And picked 7 courgettes and near a dozen cherry tomatoes. Wondering when to pick my chillis.</p>
<h3>24/01/25</h3> 
<p>Full credit to the woman who made this and put it in her garden.</p>
<h3>24/01/25</h3> 
<p>I really really really wish Id written this poem. Big ups to Leigh Hunt. Maximum respect.</p>
<h3>24/01/25</h3> 
<p>24/1/25 .Today I did 10 mostly improvised yoga poses, drummed 16 beats, 14 press ups, and did my chair pose against the wall knee exercises. I have reminded myself that my job here is not to spread bad news. You're hearing enough already. My job is to spread bad memes, odd memes, what the fuck is he even thinking memes, like how is that even a thing stuff, the occasional poem, a few laughs, photos of family and such, pictures of my garden, and any way i can think, spread good cheer. It's the only way to beat the algorithm. My friends, we need to Hope.</p>
<h3>23/01/25</h3> 
<p>Love this. Relates to quite a few things.</p>
<h3>22/01/25</h3> 
<p>You've doubtless wondered.</p>
<h3>22/01/25</h3> 
<p>Dear Diary 23 1 2025 I didnt expect to keep doing this, but at the moment its curiously helpful. I'll do it differently next month. Today I took this picture of my mates strawflowers, somehow remembered to take my vitamins, filed 7 pieces of paper, did 13 pressups, and did nine yoga stretches. A bird in the hand sounds pretty cool to me.</p>
